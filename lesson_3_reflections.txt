When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The remote repository would be accessible from any device with an internet connection.
If you keep your work local, in the event that you lose your computer, or someone hacks into
your computer, you will lose your work and not have backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you may want to have some changes on the remote but not on your local,
or vice versa. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of an existing Github repository, possibly owned by someone else, into your own account.
A clone is a copy of an existing Github repository, possibly owned by someone else, into your local Git repository.
A branch is split from an existing branch in your local Git repository. 
Forks are useful when you want to make changes to files from a repository that you do not have permission to change,
or do not want to change.
Clones are useful when you want to make changes on your computer to files from a remote repository. (It
may be easier to make changes on your computer than it is to change the file directly on the remote repository.)
Branches are useful when  you want to version a file that you are working on locally. For instance, if the master
is a game, you may want to create a branch for easy mode, and a branch for hard mode, and then maybe branches
within those branches, for instance, a branch for coins within easy mode, and a branch for monsters in hard mode.
