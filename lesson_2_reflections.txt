What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository the .git repository is created. You need to do it because
 the .git repository is where the metadata of the history of the files are stored.
 
 How is the staging area different from the working directory 
 and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 The working directory is like your usual directory of files. Changes are not tracked.
 The repository is where metadata on the changes of certain files are stored. Snapshots are stored 
 when you choose to commit changes that you've made to files in the staging directory.
 The staging directory is the intermediate area. You can choose to add files to the staging directory and make changes,
 but the changes won't be stored as commits until you commit them to the repository. It allows you to choose
 which files from the working directory to track.
